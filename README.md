## Features

This is a **fork** of [Patoke](https://github.com/Patoke/re-plants-vs-zombies) and [Headshotnoby](https://github.com/headshot2017/re-plants-vs-zombies)'s PVZ GOTY implementation with the following objectives:
- [x] Replace renderer with SDL + OpenGL
  - Also enable to **resize the window**, which was not possible in the original game
- [x] Replace Windows code with cross-platform code
- [x] Replace DirectSound/BASS/FMod with [SDL Mixer X](https://github.com/WohlSoft/SDL-Mixer-X)
  * This project uses a fork of SDL Mixer X that adds compatibility with the MO3 format by using libopenmpt. This fork is located under SexyAppFramework/sound/SDL-Mixer-X
- [x] main.pak support
- [x] **Compatible** with original PvZ GOTY Edition's ***global user data*** (profile info, adventure progress, coins, Zen Garden, etc., stored in `user*.dat`)
- [x] **Portable mid-level save game** format `.v4` support (share **mid-level saves** between Windows, Linux, macOS, Switch, etc.)
  - [x] Support export/import of `.v4` save files to/from human-readable YAML format for easy editing
- [x] Optimize memory usage for console ports (Partial)

* Port the game to these platforms:

| Platform        | Data path                    | Status                                                                                 |
|-----------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

To play the game, you need the game data from PvZ GOTY. Place `main.pak` and the `properties/` folder next to the `pvz-portable` executable (the game will search for resources relative to the executable's directory). You can also use extracted data instead of `main.pak` if you prefer.

Note about writable data and caches:

- The game will read resources (like `main.pak` and `properties/`) from the executable directory by default, so you can launch the binary from any working directory and it will still find them.
- Per-user writable files (settings, savegames, compiled caches, screenshots) are stored in the **OS-recommended application data path**. With the current build these are under `io.github.wszqkzqk/PvZPortable` and include subfolders such as:
  - `userdata/` — player save files
  - `cache64/` if you use the 64-bit version or `cache32/` if you use the 32-bit version — compiled binary caches (reanimation / compiled definitions)
  - `registry.regemu` — settings/registry emulation
  - `pvzpinfo.dat` — basic runtime stats
  - `_screenshots/` — screenshots created by the game

Examples:

- Linux: `~/.local/share/io.github.wszqkzqk/PvZPortable/`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\io.github.wszqkzqk\PvZPortable\`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/io.github.wszqkzqk/PvZPortable/`

You can customize these paths via command-line parameters:
- `-resdir <path>`: Set the **resource directory** (where `main.pak` and `properties/` are located). This only affects where the game looks for resources, not where it saves data. (The legacy `-changedir` is also accepted for backward compatibility.)
- `-savedir <path>`: Set the **save data directory** (where settings, savegames, caches, and screenshots are stored). This overrides the default OS-recommended application data path.

## Dependencies

Before building on PC, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

- **Build Tools**: `CMake`, `Ninja`, A C/C++ compiler (e.g., `gcc`, `clang`, `MSVC`)
- **Graphics**: `GLEW`, `OpenGL`
- **Audio**: `libopenmpt`, `libogg`, `libvorbis`, `mpg123`
- **Image**: `libpng`, `libjpeg-turbo`
- **Windowing/Input**: `SDL2`

### Arch Linux

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel cmake glew libjpeg-turbo libogg libopenmpt libpng libvorbis mpg123 ninja sdl2-compat
```

### Debian/Ubuntu

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install cmake ninja-build libogg-dev libglew-dev libjpeg-dev libopenmpt-dev libpng-dev libvorbis-dev libmpg123-dev libsdl2-dev
```

### Windows (MSYS2 UCRT64)

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-glew mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-libjpeg-turbo mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-libopenmpt mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-libogg mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-libpng mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-libvorbis mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-mpg123 mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-ninja mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-SDL2
```

### macOS (Homebrew)

You can install the required dependencies using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) with the following command:

```bash
brew install cmake dylibbundler glew jpeg-turbo libogg libopenmpt libpng libvorbis mpg123 ninja sdl2
```

## Build Instructions

Run the following commands (assuming you have CMake and other dependencies installed) where the `CMakeLists.txt` file is located:

```bash
cmake -G Ninja -B build
```

```bash
cmake --build build
```

### Performance Optimization

It is recommended to use the **Release** build type for the best performance, as it usually implies compiler optimizations:

```bash
cmake -G Ninja -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

For advanced users, you can also specify `CFLAGS` and `CXXFLAGS` to enable architecture-specific optimizations (e.g. `-march=native` to fully utilize your CPU's instruction set):

```bash
cmake -G Ninja -B build -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-march=native" -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-march=native" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

### Configuration Options

You can customize the game features by adding options to the first `cmake` command:

| Option | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `PVZ_DEBUG` | `OFF`<br>(`ON` if `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` is `Debug`) | Enable **cheat keys**, debug displays and other debug features. |
| `LIMBO_PAGE` | `ON` | Enable access to the limbo page which contains hidden levels. |
| `DO_FIX_BUGS` | `OFF` | Apply community fixes for "bugs" of official 1.2.0.1073 GOTY Edition.[^1] These "bugs" usually be ***considered as "features"*** by many players, though. |
| `CONSOLE` | `OFF`<br>(`ON` if `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` is `Debug`) | Show a console window (Windows only). |

[^1]: Current `DO_FIX_BUGS` includes the following fixes:
    - Fix bungee zombie duplicate sun/item drop in I, Zombie mode.
    - Mind-controlled Gargantuars smash enemy zombies instead of plants.
    - Mind-controlled Gargantuars throw mind-controlled Imps (with scale, health, and direction fixes).
    - Mind-controlled Gargantuars can smash vases in Scary Potter mode.
    - Mind-controlled Pea/Gatling Head zombies shoot forward instead of backward.
    - Mind-controlled Jalapeno/Squash zombies damage enemy zombies instead of plants.
    - Coordinate fixes for mind-controlled Squash zombies tracking and smashing enemy zombies.
    - Jalapeno zombies correctly clear Dr. Zomboss' skills (Iceball/Fireball) and ladder logic.
    - Sync Dancer Zombie animations (fixes "Maid" displacement bug).
    - Fix visual glitch of Ladder Zombie's arm recovery.
    - Fix Dr. Zomboss' attack (RV, Fireball/Iceball) and summon range coverage for 6-lane (Pool) levels.

Example: Manually enable `PVZ_DEBUG` in **Release build** so that you can use **cheat keys** while having optimized performance:

```bash
cmake -G Ninja -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DPVZ_DEBUG=ON
```

If running these commands does not create a successful build please create an issue and detail your problem.

## Save data compatibility (user data and mid-level saves)

PvZ-Portable uses two distinct types of save data:

1.  **Global User Data** (`users.dat`, `user1.dat`, etc.):
    *   Stores profile info, adventure progress, coins, Zen Garden, etc.
    *   **Fully compatible** with the original PC game format.
    *   Already portable by design (uses explicit serialization).

2.  **Mid-Level Save States** (`game1_0.v4` and `game1_0.dat`, etc.):
    *   Stores the exact state of a level when "Save and Exit" is used (zombies, projectiles, plants, etc.).
    *   The game generates **two files** for each save:
        *   `*.v4` files: **Portable format**. Sharing these files to transfer progress between different platforms is fully **supported**.
        *   `*.dat` files: **Legacy dump**. Contains raw memory dumps. **Do not share this file** across platforms as it will cause crashes due to architecture differences.
    *   When loading, the game **prefers** the `.v4` file if available.

### Why a new mid-level save format?

The original game's mid-level save format (`.dat`) effectively dumps raw memory structures to disk. This is fast but fragile, as it relies on specific memory layouts that break across:

*   **Different CPU Architectures**: x86, ARM, RISC-V, LoongArch (alignment).
*   **32-bit vs 64-bit builds**: Pointer sizes and struct layouts differ.
*   **Different Compilers**: MSVC vs GCC/Clang (padding, enum size, struct packing).

As a result, legacy saves are generally not guaranteed to load across those variants. To solve this, **Format v4** serializes game objects field-by-field using Type-Length-Value (TLV) tags. This ensures that a level saved on a x86_64 Linux machine can be loaded on a LoongArch or ARM (Switch) machine without crashing.

### Developer Guidelines for Format v4

- Add new fields as new TLV IDs; do not reuse IDs.
- Keep defaults for missing fields when loading older saves.
- Avoid raw struct dumps for data that may change layout; prefer explicit per-field sync with fixed-width primitives.

### Save Editing & Conversion Tool

There's a Python script `scripts/pvzp-v4-converter.py` to inspect and modify `.v4` save files. 

**Features:**
*   **Info**: View basic save stats (Wave, Sun, Zombies, etc.).
*   **Export to YAML**: Convert binary `.v4` files to human-readable YAML to view/edit gameplay-relevant data.
*   **Import from YAML**: Convert modified YAML back to `.v4` format with correct checksums.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Modify these paths as needed
# View basic info
python scripts/pvzp-v4-converter.py info ~/.local/io.github.wszqkzqk/PvZPortable/userdata/game1_13.v4

# Export to YAML for editing
python scripts/pvzp-v4-converter.py export ~/.local/io.github.wszqkzqk/PvZPortable/userdata/game1_13.v4 level.yaml

# Import back to savegame
# **BACKUP** your original .v4 file fist!
mv ~/.local/io.github.wszqkzqk/PvZPortable/userdata/game1_13.v4 ~/.local/io.github.wszqkzqk/PvZPortable/userdata/game1_13.v4.bak
python scripts/pvzp-v4-converter.py import level.yaml ~/.local/io.github.wszqkzqk/PvZPortable/userdata/game1_13.v4
```

## Contributing

When contributing please follow the following guides:

<details><summary>SexyAppFramework coding philosophy</summary>

### From the SexyAppFramework docs:

<br>
The framework differs from many other APIs in that some class properties are not wrapped in accessor methods, but rather are made to be accessed directly through public member data.   The window caption of your application, for example, is set by assigning a value to the std::string mTitle in the application object before the application’s window is created.  We felt that in many cases this reduced the code required to implement a class.  Also of note is the prefix notation used on variables: “m” denotes a class member, “the” denotes a parameter passed to a method or function, and “a” denotes a local variable.
