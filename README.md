## Features

This is a **fork** of [Patoke](https://github.com/Patoke/re-plants-vs-zombies) and [Headshotnoby](https://github.com/headshot2017/re-plants-vs-zombies)'s PVZ GOTY implementation with the following objectives:
- [x] Replace renderer with SDL + OpenGL
  - Also enable to **resize the window**, which was not possible in the original game
- [x] Replace Windows code with cross-platform code
- [x] Replace DirectSound/BASS/FMod with [SDL Mixer X](https://github.com/WohlSoft/SDL-Mixer-X)
  * This project uses a fork of SDL Mixer X that adds compatibility with the MO3 format by using libopenmpt. This fork is located under SexyAppFramework/sound/SDL-Mixer-X
- [x] main.pak support
- [x] Optimize memory usage for console ports (Partial)
* Port the game to these platforms:

| Platform        | Data path                    | Status                                                                                 |
|-----------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Linux (SDL2)    | Executable dir (resources); per-user app-data for writable files | Works                                                                                  |
| Windows (SDL2)  | Executable dir (resources); per-user app-data for writable files | Works                                                                                  |
| macOS (SDL2)    | Executable dir (resources); per-user app-data for writable files | Works                                                                                  |
| Haiku (SDL2)    | Executable dir (resources); per-user app-data for writable files | Partially works: no music                                                              |
| Nintendo Switch | sdmc:/switch/PlantsvsZombies | Works on real hardware. Kenji-NX crashes on boot.                           |
| Nintendo 3DS    | sdmc:/3ds/PlantsvsZombies    | In development, might not have enough memory for Old 3DS, might barely work on New 3DS |
| Nintendo Wii U  |                              | No work started yet, but planned                                                       |

To play the game, you need the game data from PvZ GOTY. Place `main.pak` and the `properties/` folder next to the `pvz-portable` executable (the game will search for resources relative to the executable's directory). You can also use extracted data instead of `main.pak` if you prefer.

Note about writable data and caches:

- The game will read resources (like `main.pak` and `properties/`) from the executable directory by default, so you can launch the binary from any working directory and it will still find them.
- Per-user writable files (settings, savegames, compiled caches, screenshots) are stored in the **OS-recommended application data path**. With the current build these are under `io.github.wszqkzqk/PlantsVsZombies` and include subfolders such as:
  - `userdata/` — player save files
  - `compiled/` — compiled binary caches (reanimation / compiled definitions)
  - `registry.regemu` — settings/registry emulation
  - `popcinfo.dat` — basic runtime stats
  - `_screenshots/` — screenshots created by the game

Examples:

- Linux: `~/.local/share/io.github.wszqkzqk/PlantsVsZombies/`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\io.github.wszqkzqk\PlantsVsZombies\`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/io.github.wszqkzqk/PlantsVsZombies/`

If you prefer to keep everything in the same folder as the executable, you can still configure a custom data directory via the `-changedir` command-line parameter when launching the game.

## Dependencies

Before building on PC, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

- **Build Tools**: `CMake`, `Ninja`, A C/C++ compiler (e.g., `gcc`, `clang`, `MSVC`)
- **Graphics**: `GLEW`, `OpenGL`
- **Audio**: `libopenmpt`, `libogg`, `libvorbis`, `mpg123`
- **Image**: `libpng`, `libjpeg-turbo`
- **Windowing/Input**: `SDL2`

### Arch Linux

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel cmake glew libjpeg-turbo libogg libopenmpt libpng libvorbis mpg123 ninja sdl2-compat
```

### Windows (MSYS2 UCRT64)

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-glew mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-libjpeg-turbo mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-libopenmpt mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-libogg mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-libpng mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-libvorbis mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-mpg123 mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-ninja mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-SDL2
```

### macOS (Homebrew)

You can install the required dependencies using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) with the following command:

```bash
brew install cmake dylibbundler glew jpeg-turbo libogg libopenmpt libpng libvorbis mpg123 ninja sdl2
```

## Build Instructions

Run the following commands (assuming you have CMake and other dependencies installed) where the `CMakeLists.txt` file is located:

```bash
cmake -G Ninja -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

```bash
cmake --build build
```

### Configuration Options

You can customize the game features by adding options to the first `cmake` command:

| Option | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `PVZ_DEBUG` | `ON` | Enable **cheat keys** and debug displays, etc. Can be used in any build type no matter debug or release. |
| `LIMBO_PAGE` | `ON` | Enable access to the limbo page which contains hidden levels. |
| `DO_FIX_BUGS` | `OFF` | Apply community fixes for "bugs" of official 1.2.0.1073 GOTY Edition.[^1] These "bugs" usually be ***considered as "features"*** by many players, though. |
| `CONSOLE` | `OFF`* | Show a console window (Windows only). *Defaults to `ON` if build type is `Debug`. (Don't be confused with `PVZ_DEBUG`.) |

[^1]: Current `DO_FIX_BUGS` includes the following fixes:
    - Fix bungee zombie duplicate sun/item drop in I, Zombie mode.
    - Mind-controlled Gargantuars smash enemy zombies instead of plants.
    - Mind-controlled Gargantuars throw mind-controlled Imps (with scale, health, and direction fixes).
    - Mind-controlled Gargantuars can smash vases in Scary Potter mode.
    - Mind-controlled Pea/Gatling Head zombies shoot forward instead of backward.
    - Mind-controlled Jalapeno/Squash zombies damage enemy zombies instead of plants.
    - Coordinate fixes for mind-controlled Squash zombies tracking and smashing enemy zombies.
    - Jalapeno zombies correctly clear Dr. Zomboss' skills (Iceball/Fireball) and ladder logic.
    - Sync Dancer Zombie animations (fixes "Maid" displacement bug).
    - Fix visual glitch of Ladder Zombie's arm recovery.
    - Fix Dr. Zomboss' attack (RV, Fireball/Iceball) and summon range coverage for 6-lane (Pool) levels.

Example: Enable `DO_FIX_BUGS` in Release build

```bash
cmake -G Ninja -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DDO_FIX_BUGS=ON
```

If running these commands does not create a successful build please create an issue and detail your problem.

When contributing please follow the following guides:

<details><summary>SexyAppFramework coding philosophy</summary>

### From the SexyAppFramework docs:

<br>
The framework differs from many other APIs in that some class properties are not wrapped in accessor methods, but rather are made to be accessed directly through public member data.   The window caption of your application, for example, is set by assigning a value to the std::string mTitle in the application object before the application’s window is created.  We felt that in many cases this reduced the code required to implement a class.  Also of note is the prefix notation used on variables: “m” denotes a class member, “the” denotes a parameter passed to a method or function, and “a” denotes a local variable.
